    "### Bond Duration\n",
    "Macaulay duration is named after the economist Frederick Macaulay, who introduced the metric in 1938 as a way to measure the volatility of the price of a bond, or portfolio of bonds, to changes in interest rates. It is the weighted average time until the present value of the bondâ€™s cash flows equals the current market price for the bond. Macaulay duration is measured in years and is often used by portfolio managers who implement bond immunization strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modified duration was developed as a response to the sharp interest rate rises in the 1970s, as a method to assess a bonds sensitivity to interest rate changes. Modified duration 'modifies' Macaulay duration by multiplying it by 1 / (1 + (YTM / frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstate the calculation of a bonds Macaulay and Modified duration. For this purpose I encapsulate the calculations in a Bond class. Calculations from the Bond class are validated against a similar bond created using the Quantlib library."
